# Problem: Time of day can be represented as a number before or after midnight. Positive
#          time is after midnight, negative before midnight. Write a method that take a 
#          time using this minute format and return time in 24 hour format (hh:mm)


# Input:  Integer, positive or negative
# Output: String with time of input in 24 hour format (hh:mm)


# Requirements:
#      - Explicit: 
#             - Can NOT use ruby Date and Time classes
#             - Method should work with any input integer
#             - Must return a string in 24 hour format (hh:mm)
#             - Disregard daylight savings and standard time and other complications
#             - 0 should return "00:00"
#      - Implicit
#             - None for this problem
