# Problem: Write a method that return the next to last word of a string argument

# Input:  String
# Output: Second to last word in string

# Requirements
#    - Explicit: 
#       - Words are any sequence of non-black characters
#       - Input string will always contain at least 2 words
#       - return the second to last word in the string
#    - Implicit:
#       - None for this problem


# Data Structure/ Algorithm
#    - Take input string and break it up with split, which will give us array of strings
#      with each element being sepereated by the spaces in the string
#    - Return the second to last element in the string with array referencing
